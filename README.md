# Cordova Image Picker Plus

Cordova Plugin For Multiple Image Selection - implemented for iOS and Android.
Compatiple with https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/ImagePicker

## Android: Enable Kotlin into config.xml file

```
<preference name="GradlePluginKotlinEnabled" value="true"/>

```

## Installing the plugin

    # Remove cordova-plugin-telerik-imagepicker if exist
    cordova plugin rm cordova-plugin-telerik-imagepicker

    # Install
    cordova plugin add <path>/ImagePicker --variable PHOTO_LIBRARY_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="your usage message"

## Using the plugin

The plugin creates the object `window.imagePicker` with the method `getPictures(success, fail, options)`

Example - Get Full Size Images (all default options):

```javascript
window.imagePicker.getPictures(
  function (results) {
    for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
      console.log('Image URI: ' + results[i]);
    }
  },
  function (error) {
    console.log('Error: ' + error);
  }
);
```

Example - Get at most 10 images scaled to width of 800:

```javascript
window.imagePicker.getPictures(
  function (results) {
    for (var i = 0; i < results.length; i++) {
      console.log('Image URI: ' + results[i]);
    }
  },
  function (error) {
    console.log('Error: ' + error);
  },
  {
    maximumImagesCount: 10,
    width: 800,
  }
);
```

### Options

    options = {
        maximumImagesCount: int,

        // max width and height to allow the images to be.  Will keep aspect
        // ratio no matter what.  So if both are 800, the returned image
        // will be at most 800 pixels wide and 800 pixels tall.  If the width is
        // 800 and height 0 the image will be 800 pixels wide if the source
        // is at least that wide.
        width: int,
        height: int,

        // quality of resized image, defaults to 100
        quality: int (0-100),

        // output type, defaults to FILE_URIs.
        // available options are
        // window.imagePicker.OutputType.FILE_URI (0) or
        // window.imagePicker.OutputType.BASE64_STRING (1)
        outputType: int
    };

### Note for Android Use

When outputType is FILE_URI the plugin returns images that are stored in a temporary directory. These images will often not be deleted automatically though. The files should be moved or deleted after you get their filepaths in javascript. If Base64 Strings are being returned, there is nothing to clean up.
